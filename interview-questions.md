# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: The process of running an algorithm multiple times until a condition is met. Kind of like when I eat an entire box of chicken nuggets. I repeatedly consume one at a time, until they're all gone, because I'm not a quitter.

  Researched answer: In addition to the statement, "until a condition is met", I would add that an iteration can also stop when commanded to. They are more commonly known as loops in JavaScript and the "for" loop is the one that I am the most familiar with.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: I believe they are index, array, and value. However, I am not sure about which of these is required.

  Researched answer: The value parameter is the only one that is required. After doing some research I believe this is the required parameter due to the nature of the method .map(). It converts each item in a function, so in order to accomplish that it needs a value to base the function off of.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: The way that I understand destructuring is that it can break down information and allows that information to be reassigned with new variables.

  Researched answer: After my research I have noticed that destructuring mostly applies to retrieving values from arrays. It may also be used for retrieving properties from objects, which include, instance and static properties. Instance properties hold specific data for an object while static properties hold data that is shared among objects. Once the data from either property is retrieved it may then be reassigned to a new variable.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is something that can be called on by the title of it, such as Map or filter. A method is contained within an object and is called on by the object instead.

  Researched answer: Functions are predefined by JavaScript and methods are created by the developer and held within an object to be called upon for whatever solution they are attempting to achieve.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: I believe that objects are contained within classes and execute a command based on how the class is designed.

  Researched answer: Classes are templates that contains created objects. Objects follow the behavior of the predefined class, which is capable of holding numerous objects.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: The act of raising or lifting inside JavaScript.

  Researched answer: I watched a YouTube video on this and it seems to be the act of declaring a variable after the console.log. For example, d = "Fourth"; then console.log(d); followed by var d;. The variable, "d", is undefined until after the console.log, but hoisting allows for it to be recognized due to the fact that d = "fourth"; was already established prior to it. Named functions just like variables get "hoisted" to the top of the file in JavaScript, so that we can use these at any point inside of our code. This can cause the browser to slow down slightly, so developers tend to avoid hoisting if they can.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Makes it possible to extend a created class to another class. This allows the function within the original class to be inherited by a new class without writing additional code for it.

2. React: React is a library of information for JavaScript that is utilized to build the front-end part of the development process. It seems that it is primarily used for UI components. It is very flexible and able to create work on different platforms.

3. React state: It is a plain object such as this.state, which represents a component's current situation within the code. It shows the state of a component that has the ability to change.

4. React lifecycle methods: This sounds like it is the same thing as built in methods for JavaScript such as Map.

5. DOM: Document Object Model. It represents the entire user interface of an application that is given in a tree data structure.
